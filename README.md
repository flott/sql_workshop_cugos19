# Solving Spatial Problems with Queries

CUGOS Fall Fling Workshop, 2019-10-06

## Session Description
*Solving Spatial Problems with Queries* is an introduction to using SQL with spatial extensions to create reports, summarize data, and explore spatial relationships. We will use [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/) 3.8 to conduct SQL queries on tabular and spatial data. This workshop will focus on [Spatialite](https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index), but the concepts are applicable to [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) and to some extent, MySQL and SQL Server. Please bring your laptop with [QGIS 3.8](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html) installed. Some familiarity with SQL, QGIS, and spatial concepts will come in handy, but beginners are welcome.
